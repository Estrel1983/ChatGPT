"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2023","Steph","yes","-","Seemed to work!","I wipe my long haired Dachshund when she goes potty so the bit that stays in the hair down there doesn’t get on the rugs/blankets and I noticed she was bleeding just a bit when she’d pee (not in heat) and even though that was her only symptom, I got concerned and ordered the drops to try to nip it in the bud if that’s what it was. I put it on her food and followed the directions, she ate it and her symptoms went away!",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKA9HH5UPO7EK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B53WDY4M","-","-"

"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2023","Amazon Customer","yes","-","Effective treatment at a reasonable price","This product helped my dogs UTI symptoms rather quickly. It helped reduce the urgency to go and when she did go it was more productive. (Begining symptoms were frequent and short urination) It must not have a bad taste because I put it in both her water and mixed it with her food and she ate and drank with no hesitation.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I0LYPOVUHGH4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B53WDY4M","-","-"
